<p>This project was developed to find trends in the data provided by Census in 2015. Each visualization created shows helps us gain new insights and understand the population in The United States better.</p>

## Insight #1: The higher the population of a state the higher their income is

### Summary of insight:
<p>As I was exploring the dataset I wanted to find out what are the trends in regard to income in different states. As I made this visualization I added total population to the tooltip of the map. This made me conclude that the higher the population of a state the higher their income is. One of the most populous states is Texas, and sure enough it is the one that has the highest income out of The United States according to this dataset from 2015. Another takeaway I saw in this map is that besides Texas, the Midwest of the U.S. seems to be doing better in regard to their income when compared to other states.</p>

### Design of choice description:
<p>I chose a map to represent this information because it gives the viewer a better understanding of the data being presented. At first glance, without looking into the data it contains the viewer already knows they are about to learn about these states. The colors were chosen considering color blindness. People who have this type of vision impairment have difficulty seeing shades of green and red. Which is why I avoided them and tried using
colors that have a higher contrast.</p>

## Insight #2: Top Jobs in Texas are private work, professional, office, public work, construction and production.

### Summary of Insight:
<p>After the realization that Texas has the highest income of all states, I wanted to see what people worked with in the state. This visualization shows that most people in Texas do private work, professional work comes in second, and office in third. This means that when you meet someone from Texas, they are very likely to work in the areas shown in this visualization.</p>

### Design of choice description:
<p>The visualization is organized by highest to lowest, that way is easy to identify which jobs are most popular. The X and Y axis are easily understandable through labels. After some research I realized that Tableau has a color palette named Color Blind which avoids colors that may be difficult to see if the viewer has this vision impairment. This palette was used on purpose to make this visualization more accessible. Only one color from the palette was used in the bars as colors could represent something else and confuse the viewer.</p>

## Insight #3: Insight #3: Private work is the top source of income of all states.

### Summary of insight:
<p>I created this dashboard to be able to present the information I learned beforehand in more of an interactive way. If the viewer clicks on a state in the map the bar chart at the bottom will change and show the job data for the chosen state. It appears that all states make more money with private work. Which means they make most of their money from companies that work with retail, finance, healthcare, technology, restaurants, hospitality, and manufacturing. I also added a pie chart to the bottom of the dashboard which gives us new insights. The pie chart shows the diversity of each state according to the filter applied by the map. This helps us understand who the population from specific states is. To see this, I recommend taking a look at Georgia. If you hover over the slices in the pie chart it shows that they have a population of 967 Hispanics compared to Puerto Rico where job trends are similar the Hispanic population is 7726. No matter what the diversity of a state is, the job trends are the same. You can also explore the data by filtering the state diversity on the right of the pie chart</p>

### Design of choice description:
<p>This dashboard was made to easily present the information I learned beforehand with enhanced interactivity. The colors remain the same as they were in the previous worksheets to maintain the visualization accessible. There are two ways the viewer can explore this visualization which is by either clicking the map to see job data or by clicking the state filter on the top left of the dashboard which can be useful if the viewer is not used to The United Statesâ€™ geography. The pie chart follows the same color palette as the bar chart again as an attempt to prioritize accessibility.</p>
